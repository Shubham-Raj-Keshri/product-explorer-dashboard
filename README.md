# Product Explorer Dashboard

A production-style frontend application built using **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The app fetches product data from a public API and provides search, filtering, favorites, and detailed product views.

This project was developed as part of a frontend technical assignment to demonstrate clean architecture, API integration, and client-side state management.
